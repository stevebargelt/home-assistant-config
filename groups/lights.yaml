    # this is a work-around for the fact that group.all_switches includes the 
    #   water kettle which does nto report state so if it's off, turning "Off" 
    #   everything turns the water kettle On. The water kettle turns itself off
    #   after about an hour anyway. Will add state detection to water kettle one
    #   day soon!
